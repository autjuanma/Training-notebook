Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL)  || or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL)


Use SOQL when you know which objects the data resides in, and you want to:
Retrieve data from a single object or from multiple objects that are related to one another.
Count the number of records that meet specified criteria.
Sort results as part of the query.
Retrieve data from number, date, or checkbox fields.

# What is the different between SOQL AND SOSL?


* SOQL(Saleforce object query lenguage)

Only one object can be searched at a time
Can query any time of field
Can be used in classes and triggers
DML Operation can be performed on query results
return records


* SOSL(Saleforce object Search Language)

Many objects can be search at time
Can query only on email , text or phone
Can be used in classes but not triggers
DML Operation cannot be performed on search results
Return fields

Contact c = new Contact(Account = [SELECT Name FROM Account
    WHERE NumberOfEmployees > 10 LIMIT 1]);
c.FirstName = 'James';
c.LastName = 'Yoyce';
Contact c = new Contact(Account=[SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE NumberOfEmployees > 10 LIMIT 1]);
c.firstName = 'juan'
c.LastName ='tech'


Integer i = [SELECT COUNT() FROM Contact WHERE LastName = 'Weissman'];
Integer j = 5 * [SELECT COUNT() FROM Account];


SOSL Statements

List<List<SObject>> searchList = [FIND 'map*' IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account (Id, Name), Contact, Opportunity, Lead];


"Find" on apex


FIND 'map*' IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account (Id, Name), Contact, Opportunity, Lead


Arrays

Account [] accounts = ((List<Account>)searchList[0]);
Contact [] contacts = ((List<Contact>)searchList[1]);
Opportunity [] opportunities = ((List<Opportunity>)searchList[2]);
Lead [] leads = ((List<Lead>)searchList[3]);
